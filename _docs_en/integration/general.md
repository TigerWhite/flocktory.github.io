Before you can use the Flocktory platform for your website you need to perform the main integration.

Install the following code on ALL of the pages of your website. It should be placed either in the `<head>` section or in the end of the `<body>` section.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://api.flocktory.com/v2/loader.js?site_id=YOUR_SITE_ID" async="async"></script>
```

This code is common for all Flocktory products and you only have to put it once to your system, no matter how many products you want to activate.

ATTENTION: you have to replace YOUR_SITE_ID with your website’s Flocktory ID.

You can find your websites ID in your Flocktory admin area (Profile/MySites) in at [cabinet.flocktory.com](https://cabinet.flocktory.com/) – or request the ID from your account manager.
